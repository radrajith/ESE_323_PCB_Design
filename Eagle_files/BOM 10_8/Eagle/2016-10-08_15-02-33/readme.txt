To import your new BOARD file into Eagle:

1. Unzip the downloaded folder files to local directory and Start Eagle.
2. Select "File"->"Open"->"Board..." from the menu at the top of
the screen.
3. Browse to your newly exported file and select the ".brd" file extension.
4. Planes will need to be repoured to update the polygon fills
	1. Once your board is loaded and before the repour, the default design rule
	   should be updated for Mask and thermal relief.
		a. Goto Edit and select Design Rules.
			-Select Masks Tab; Set Stop (Min & Max) to 0.0mm
			-Select Supply Tab; Set Thermal Isolation to 0.0mm
	2. To pour the polygon fills, goto Tools and select Ratsnest
	3. The polygons should all be filled now.
5. You should now have an image of your board available in Eagle.
